# Tasks Manager

My final project for "ASP.NET Core MVC bootcamp" with [Tuwaiq](https://tuwaiq.edu.sa/) Academy.

This web app has two layouts, one for the regular user (staff), and one for the manager. Only the manager can create and assign tasks, and groups.

## Home

Where staff can view tasks assigned by manager, and mark them as complete.
This layout has 4 pages:
 - Overview page, with basic stats.
 - Tasks page, where complete and incomplete tasks are shown.
 - Groups page, where groups and group tasks and members are shown.
 - Finally a profile page, where the user can view and edit **display name**, **profile image**, and set a **manager**.

## Dashboard

Where a manager can **create**, **edit**, and **delete** tasks and groups. And where users can be **accepted** to be under your management.
The dashboard layout has 5 pages:
 - Overview page, with basic stats.
 - Users page, where staffing requests are received and either accepted or rejected. And where you can view your staff; users can be clicked to view their information, tasks and groups.
 - Tasks page, where tasks can be **created**, **edited**, and **deleted**.
 - Groups page, where groups are **created**, **viewed**, and **edited**.
 - Profile page.
